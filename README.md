Memory games play an important role to help children develop important skills in a fun and engaging way. From a young age, memory games can help children learn how to remember, recognize, and recall information in a fun manner. Not only do they promote cognitive development, but they also help to improve concentration, creativity and problem-solving skills. 
This project aims at the development of a game which is not only fun and engaging but also impactful in a positive way. Not just like any other monotonous memory game, this game aspires to be engaging through different themes provided to the user developed using the frontend languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, intriguing the challenging spirit by providing a stipulated time to complete 
the game using the backend technologies like Node Js and JavaScript, and additionally some other elements like moves and the responsive refresh button. 
The game will look like:
